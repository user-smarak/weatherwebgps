This a beginner website for checking weather and fetching weather api and extracting data from it to disolay on my website. Displays any city you type, and gives and alert when the city is
invalid or not found. The navbar beside it consists of source whic takes you to the Open Weather website and the About us takes user to my github page. The button named ' Your Location' on the 
right side of the card, when clicked, asks for location permission and shows the user's location via latitude and longitude. And beside it is a converter which converts entered temperature in 
celcius to fahrenheit and can display it upto 3 decimal points. The background image loads itself according to the weather.
